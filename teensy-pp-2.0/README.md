# Teensy++ 2.0 Software Examples

I have a Teensy++ 2.0 USB development board (CPU: AT90USB1286, 8 bit AVR, 16
MHz). This repository contains the miscellaneous programs I write for this
board.


## Setup

Follow the instructions on [Teensy USB Development Board: Getting
Started](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/first_use.html) to install the
Teensy Loader program for programming the board. Software that run on
the board can be written in C (see [The GCC Compiler and
Tools](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gcc.html)) or Arduino with
Teensyduino (see [Tutorial 1: Software
Setup](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html)). I generally prefer
the latter method, which is easier for starters.

## Code

Software can be found in the [src](./src) directory.
